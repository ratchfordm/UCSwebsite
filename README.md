## User Views

### Seller/Standard User
- Page for inputing items into the system
- Page for printing out barcodes to label their items

- Probably some other stuff (not part of MVP)

### Checkout System
- Page for adding items to checkout
- Page for Checking out/seeing the total

- Page for Adding Events
- Page for Viewing/Editing Events
- Page for Editing/Removing Items
- Super Admin Page for adding Admins
- Super Admin Page for viewing/editing/removing Admins

By no means is this list exaustive, and will be added on to if needed
